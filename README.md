## 💡 Inspiration
The stock market is volatile with factors that can affect its performance, making it difficult to predict. Whereas, as institutions employ sophisticated analytics, retail investors work with little raw data. Most existing models either capture trends over time or the causal influences without consistent profitability.

This project integrates time-series analysis with causal inference in order to improve prediction accuracy by modeling cause-and-effect relationships in stock price movements. The machine learning approach provides a new avenue to address challenges such as noise and non-stationarity given the advancement of machine learning and increasing access to vast amount of financial data, eventually making it a highly relevant and relatable problem for the team.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Objective of this project is to build a predictive model for stock prices by combining time series forecasting and causal analysis to understand key factors influencing stock market trends. The expected outcomes of this project:
- A predictive model for stock price forecasting using time series.
- A graph-based model incorporating cross-sectoral dependencies for enhanced prediction.
- A comprehensive report detailing model performance and key causal factors identified.

### Use cases:
- Cross-sectoral analysis of stock dependencies for portfolio optimization.
- Enhanced prediction of price movements with causal relationships.
- Advanced risk assessment for institutional and retail investors.
